# Helsinki_ApiData

The app using Helsinki open API data to allow users search for places, events and incoming activities in the city
using Reactjs in the frontend and Nodejs/express in the backend.

## To run the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
- Install Node.js

- Because I didn't structure the code well from the beginning, therefore you may need to install some extra codes :)

cd to each of these directory hsk, src (inside client), and server, then run:
```
npm install
```
3. Finally, we can now run the app.
- In server directory and run:
```
node app.js
```
- In client/hsk directory, run:
```
npm start
```

That's it :) !
